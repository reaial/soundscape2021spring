\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this preview I am showing you the little bits and pieces of my morning, and slightly into my afternoon. The pieces here are representing what my life is like when I am alone for a majority of my day and all I do is work. So this is what these pieces are represented in the first half of the file. I will attempt to show what it is like when all of my friends who are athletes come home after practice, since I cannot do it anymore and I am not occupied with my time as much as I used to be in the second portion of the file. The last few things that are added are from my alarm, too when I go to see my friends. There are a few other things that I need to add in order to really give an in depth analysis of what life is. The other things that I want to really try to prevail is the way that life is for a lot of people now that we have been stuck inside for over a year. Making it so that it is more relatable for others than just for myself. }
