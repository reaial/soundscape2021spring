Forever Changing

For my project I wanted to show you the sounds of my everyday life. I think that it will be the best way to interpret how my life goes now that I do not do the sport that I used to play, while also showing how boring it might sound for everyone ever since covid hit. The ways that the days are set up now, it is either the complete same everyday or there is a little bit of contrast within them. So, I wanted to show what two very different days would sound like for me. I just want to say that I wanted to add conversation to this piece, but my friends and I conversation topics are no where near appropriate, and there is a lot of cussing as well.
