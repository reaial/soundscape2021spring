This is my repository

for my project I want to do the sounds of my everyday life
I think that it will be the best way to interpret how my life goes now that I do not do the sport that I used to play, while also showing
how boring it might sound for everyone ever since covid hit  
 I just want to say that I would add conversation to this piece, but my friends and I conversation topics are no where near appropriate
